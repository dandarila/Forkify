# Forkify
A site for recipes using an API build as a project for The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!. 
The code and design are written to Jonas Schmedtmann.
I just follow the instructions and wrote again the project. 
In order to work you should download a copy, install node.js, run "npm install" to install all the packages you need for the project and then 
write in the command line : "npm run start" to open the page in browser. 
You have a search field where you can search for recipes using a keyword as : meat, soup, pizza. 
The recipes will appear on the left and if you want to see the details you just click on the one. You can also add it to your favorites and it will be stored in local storage so, the next time you open the project it will still be added as your favourite.
